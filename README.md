## Code Repo  

This repository contains the course content and code which I use for the online courses that I will be taking.  
I have finished one course on Machine Learning which i added in a different repo.  
From now on I will be adding the courses in here.  

# Machine Learning  
[https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse]  
Started taking the course on Machine Learning by Yaser Abu Mostafa.  
I will be taking the notes as I watch the videos, so I will be making a quick note of the lecture.  
It may not contain everything that's talked about in the lectures.  
Anyone who is taking the same course and wishes to contribute to the lecture notes, can make changes or additions.
