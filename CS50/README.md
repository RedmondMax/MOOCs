**Harvard's CS 50[https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/]**  

I have taken few lectures of this course back when I was in college and thought of taking the course from the recent years.  
This course is not only a great introductory course for Computer Science, but it also has a very enthusiastic instructor David Malan.  
26/6/2018 I finished the first lecture from Week 0.
